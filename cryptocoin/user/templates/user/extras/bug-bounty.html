                <p class="lead">GenCyberCoin has a bug bounty program! This program will reward you with coins if you can find bugs (problems & errors) on the website.</p>
                <p class="lead">Try to do something that the website would not expect a normal user to do. If you find a bug, you will see a special message and be rewarded with some coins!</p>
                <p class="lead">Bug Bounty hunting is a real-world practice where people can receive monetary rewards on websites including <u><a href="https://www.hackerone.com/" target="_blank">HackerOne</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/bug-bounty-list/" target="_blank">BugCrowd</a></u>. It can be quite profitable to participate in these “ethical hacking” Bug Bounty program events. A 10-year-old was reward $10,000 by Facebook in 2016 for finding a serious bug on Instagram! You can read more about that story here: Click <u><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/2016/5/3/11579972/facebook-10-year-old-hacking-instagram-security-bug-10k" target="_blank">here</a></u>.</p>
                <p class="lead">Bruce Schneier, a very well-known American cryptographer, has his own blog page and writes about current topics and issues in today’s cyberworld.</p>
                <p class="lead">A short essay on hackers written by Schneier can be read on his website: Click <u><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/09/what_is_a_hacke.html" target="_blank">here</a></u>.</p>
                <p class="lead">You can also check out some current top-level security investigations through this website: Click <u><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/" target="_blank">here</a></u>.</p>
                <p class="lead">IMPORTANT: Before performing a cyberattack, ALWAYS think about the ethics of the attack first. Performing an unethical cyberattack will result in heavy charges (prison time, large fine, etc.) that will be placed upon you.</p>
                <!--<p class="lead">What happens if someone performed an attack in an unethical way? They may go to prison and owe a large fine as the <u><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/04/marcus-malwaretech-hutchins-pleads-guilty-to-writing-selling-banking-malware/" target="_blank">MalwareTech's case</a></u>. So, make sure that you always, ALWAYS think about ethics first.</p> -->
                <p class="lead">For this website though, you can try to break it in any way you want!</p>
                <p class="lead">Here's a hint: Right-click on a specific item on any page and select “Inspect” to see the underlying code.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="sublead">Sensitive data exposure (hidden page that admin left somewhere on the home page's source code)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Broken authentication (find admin credentials)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Find a proposed standard which allows websites to define security policies (search this in the Internet and you shall stand on the path to find the answer to this one)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">User data input overflow (check out maxlength in page sources)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Reflected XSS (check out wallet)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Stored XSS (btw, did you leave us the feedback yet?)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">User input validation (wallet)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">HTML edits on social engineering page (how does the server know what question relate to what answer?)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Have you thought what happens if you transfer coins to yourself? (find in the wallet's page source the numerical values that correspond to users, replace one of them with yours: either guess it or the Blockchain page may help you)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Local file inclusion (did you see that there are several pages of the items on the market?)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">HTML edits on market items (can you change the price of the items so that the money will actually come to you when you buy, instead of going out of your pocket?)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Race condition (when market is enabled, notice what changes in every item's HTML code when it is your turn; then, when it is not your turn, can you still try to buy something?)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Refresh on remove (when market is on)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Access a page that does not exist</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Break the hash of wonderwoman and log in to her account (you will find it when you solve bug#2)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Find a forgotten form on Cryptocurrency page and use it to unlock Atlantis (check out the page source; inspect the elements on the page and look for a form which display is none; find out how to make that form visible)</li>
                    <li class="sublead">Cause a CSRF failure (learn about CSRF; notice that the forms, where you can submit something, always have some kind of hidden field in it; what happens when you delete it and submit)</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="lead">Note: If you see a page with a yellow background with random code, this means that you have found an actual bug. Please report this bug to Vitaly Ford (<span style="color: #0000ff;">fordv@arcadia.edu</span>
