                <p class="lead">Cryptocurrency (digital currency) is booming and continues to do so today. It is a type of currency that does not need a bank to operate. All transactions made with cryptocurrency happen online and can be anonymous, preserving the security and privacy of every user involved in a transaction. One of the most important security topics, <i>cryptography</i>, makes cryptocurrency possible.</p>
                <p class="lead"> Check out how cryptography works through this video: Click <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXCTbFnK8o&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&index=35&t=0s" target="_blank">here</a></u>.</p>
                <p class="lead">GenCyberCoin was developed in order to demonstrate that cryptocurrency can be used to receive rewards that later can be redeemed to perform money transactions, as well as purchase real goods. You will be rewarded for finding bugs on this website (check out the Bug Bounty page!) and answering Reconnaissance questions.</p>

            <hr>
            <div class="normal-text">
                <p class="lead">In the real world, the cryptocurrency market is very unstable and can change drastically from hour to hour. For example, one single Bitcoin may be valued at $10,000 today and can either rise to $11,000 or drop to $9,000 the next day.</p>
                <p class="lead">In order to make market goods on the GenCyberCoin Market more realistic, the cost of every item will vary depending on how many GenCyberCoins every user owns and how many items have been purchased. </p>
                <p class="lead">Keep an eye out on the price tag when the time comes to purchase goods from the market! If you add something in your cart based on the current price, it may change the next time you see it!</p>
